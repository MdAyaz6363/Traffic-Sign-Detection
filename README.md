# "TRAFFIC SIGN DETECTION USING A CASECADE METHOD AND IOT‚Äù 
This is the Automatic traffic sign detection is challenging due to the complexity of scene images, and fast detection is required in real applications such as driver assistance systems. 
In this paper, we propose a fast traffic sign detection method based on a cascade method.
It is highly used in real time vehicle.
This project is based on Matlab.
